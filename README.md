# Sales-Overview-Analysis

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyse key performance metrics such as Sales, Profit, and Quantity across four regions: Central, East, South, and West for LXX Office Supplies.

The dashboard must allow users to filter data by year and switch between metrics, providing a year-over-year comparison of sales, profit, and quantity. Additionally, the solution should visually display trends and regional/state-level breakdowns to enable better decision-making.
